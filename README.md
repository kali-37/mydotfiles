## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a collection of dot files, scripts, and setups that I personally use to enhance my development workflow. These configurations are tailored to my preferences and the tools I commonly work with. Feel free to browse and take inspiration from them.

## Description

The "MyDotFiles" repository is a collection of various configuration files for tools such as:

- Shell (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc)
- Editors (e.g., .vimrc, .vscode settings)
- Terminal customizations
- Git (e.g., .gitconfig, .gitignore)

Additionally, you may find utility scripts and snippets that I've gathered from various online sources or developed myself.

Please note that these configurations are provided as-is, and they may or may not work seamlessly with your system or software versions. Before using them, I recommend backing up your existing configurations to avoid any unintended consequences.

## Usage

To make use of these dot files, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subash1237/mydotfiles.git
